  "title": "Mimicking Word Embeddings using Subword RNNs",
  "abstract": "Word embeddings improve generalization over lexical features by placing each word in a lower-dimensional space, using distributional information obtained from unlabeled data.  However, the effectiveness of word embeddings for downstream NLP tasks is limited by out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, for which embeddings do not exist.  In this paper, we present MIMICK, an approach to generating OOV word embeddings compositionally, by learning a function from spellings to distributional embeddings.  Unlike prior work, MIMICK does not require re-training on the original word embedding corpus; instead, learning is performed at the type level.  Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations demonstrate the power of this simple approach.  On 23 languages, MIMICK improves performance over a word-based baseline for tagging part-of-speech and morphosyntactic attributes.  It is competitive with (and complementary to) a supervised characterbased model in low-resource settings.",
  "introduction": "One of the key advantages of word embeddings for natural language processing is that they enable generalization to words that are unseen in labeled training data, by embedding lexical features from large unlabeled datasets into a relatively low-dimensional Euclidean space. These low-dimensional embeddings are typically trained to capture distributional similarity, so that information can be shared among words that tend to appear in similar contexts. However, it is not possible to enumerate the entire vocabulary of any language, and even large unlabeled datasets will miss terms that appear in later applications. The issue of how to handle these out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words poses challenges for embedding-based methods. These challenges are particularly acute when working with lowresource languages, where even unlabeled data may be difficult to obtain at scale. A typical solution is to abandon hope, by assigning a single OOV embedding to all terms that do not appear in the unlabeled data. We approach this challenge from a quasigenerative perspective. Knowing nothing of a word except for its embedding and its written form, we attempt to learn the former from the latter. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) on the character level with the embedding as the target, and use it later to predict vectors for OOV words in any downstream task. We call this model the MIMICK-RNN, for its ability to read a wordâ€™s spelling and mimick its distributional embedding. Through nearest-neighbor analysis, we show that vectors learned via this method capture both word-shape features and lexical features. As a result, we obtain reasonable near-neighbors for OOV abbreviations, names, novel compounds, and orthographic errors. Quantitative evaluation on the Stanford RareWord dataset (Luong et al., 2013) provides more evidence that these character-based embeddings capture word similarity for rare and unseen words. As an extrinsic evaluation, we conduct experiments on joint prediction of part-of-speech tags and morphosyntactic attributes for a diverse set of 23 languages, as provided in the Universal Dependencies dataset (De Marneffe et al., 2014). Our model shows significant improvement across the board against a single UNK-embedding backoff method, and obtains competitive results against a supervised character-embedding model, which is trained end-to-end on the target task. In low-resource settings, our approach is particularly effective, and is complementary to supervised character embeddings trained from labeled data. The MIMICK-RNN therefore provides a useful new tool for tagging tasks in settings where there is limited labeled data. Models and code are available at www.github.com/ yuvalpinter/mimick .",
  "conclusion": "We present a straightforward algorithm to infer OOV word embedding vectors from pre-trained, limited-vocabulary models, without need to access the originating corpus. This method is particularly useful for low-resource languages and tasks with little labeled data available, and in fact is task-agnostic. Our method improves performance over word-based models on annotated sequence-tagging tasks for a large variety of languages across dimensions of family, orthography, and morphology. In addition, we present a Bi- LSTM approach for tagging morphosyntactic attributes at the token level. In this paper, the MIMICK model was trained using characters as input, but future work may consider the use of other subword units, such as morphemes, phonemes, or even bitmap representations of ideographic characters (Costa-juss`a et al., 2017)."
