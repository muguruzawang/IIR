Imagine you are a scientific researcher and you are writing an academic paper. You have already completed the Abstract section of the target paper and have already collected the reference papers that should be included in the related work section. Now your task is to write the related work section of the target paper. Please read the target paper and the reference papers carefully, and generate the related work section according to the following steps:

#Step 1: Read the target paper and understand the main content of this paper precisely.

#Step 2: Read the reference papers one by one and identify the relationship of each reference paper and the target paper. Figure out the reason why the reference papers should be cited in the related work section. And summarize the reference papers in academic and concise manner.

#Step 3: Make sure the generated related work section fulfill the following objectives: (1) situates your work within the broader scholarly community - connects your work to the broader field and shows that your work has grown organically from current trends; (2)illustrates a “gap” in previous researches; (3) if needed, shows how you achieve the improvement compared with previous researches.

The input will be given in the following JSON format:

{
 "Target Paper":
 {
  "Title": xxxx,
  "Abstract":xxxx,
  "introduction":xxxx,
  "conclusion":xxxx
  },
 "Reference Papers":
 {
  "@cite_1":
   {
   "Title": xxxx,
   "Abstract":xxxx,
   "introduction":xxxx,
   "conclusion":xxxx,
   "other sections":xxxx
   },
   ...
   "@cite_n":
   {
   "Title": xxxx,
   "Abstract":xxxx,
   "introduction":xxxx,
   "conclusion":xxxx,
   "other sections":xxxx
   }
 }
}

"Target Paper" includes four key-value pairs: "title", "abstract", "introduction", and "conclusion".
"Reference Papers" contains multiple key-value pairs, where each key is a unique citation identifier (e.g., "@cite_1", ..., "@cite_n"), and each value is an object representing a reference paper. For each reference paper object, the meta information of the paper is provided, including "title", "abstract", "introduction", "conclusion", and "other sections". 

In the above input format, "@cite_1" ... "@cite_n" should be the citation markers of the corresponding references, which means when you cite one reference paper, you should use "@cite_?" to represent the corresponding reference paper. 

Please also remember not to leave out any given reference.

The output should resemble the following format, but not include any content from the example:
"Early works usually learn sentence representations by augmenting the idea of word2vec (@cite_2), such as predicting surrounding sentences (@cite_1, @cite_6) or summing up n-gram embeddings (@cite_10). With the rise of pre-trained language models, many works try to generate sentence representations through BERT-like models. A common way is leveraging the [CLS] embedding or applying mean pooling on the last layers of BERT (@cite_3, @cite_4). Instead of using BERT embeddings directly, BERT-Flow (@cite_7) and BERT-Whitening (@cite_8) further improve sentence representation through post-processing.  Recently, several works adopt the contrastive learning framework for sentence representation learning. They propose different strategies to constitute contrastive pairs, either through different data transforming methods (@cite_11), or through encoders with different structures or parameters (@cite_12). A typical example SimCSE (@cite_15) uses dropout as data augmentation strategy and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, most existing works pay little attention to the training objective and use the traditional contrastive loss directly, which is insufficient in discrimination and unable to model the partial order of semantics between sentences. So, in our work, we propose a new approach that jointly models the pairwise and triple-wise sentence relations and further improves the sentence representations’ quality."


Now I will give the input as follows:
