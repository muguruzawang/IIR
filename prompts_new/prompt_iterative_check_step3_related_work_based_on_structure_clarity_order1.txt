 "Target Paper": {
  "title": "Mimicking Word Embeddings using Subword RNNs",
  "abstract": "Word embeddings improve generalization over lexical features by placing each word in a lower-dimensional space, using distributional information obtained from unlabeled data.  However, the effectiveness of word embeddings for downstream NLP tasks is limited by out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, for which embeddings do not exist.  In this paper, we present MIMICK, an approach to generating OOV word embeddings compositionally, by learning a function from spellings to distributional embeddings.  Unlike prior work, MIMICK does not require re-training on the original word embedding corpus; instead, learning is performed at the type level.  Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations demonstrate the power of this simple approach.  On 23 languages, MIMICK improves performance over a word-based baseline for tagging part-of-speech and morphosyntactic attributes.  It is competitive with (and complementary to) a supervised characterbased model in low-resource settings.",
  "introduction": "One of the key advantages of word embeddings for natural language processing is that they enable generalization to words that are unseen in labeled training data, by embedding lexical features from large unlabeled datasets into a relatively low-dimensional Euclidean space. These low-dimensional embeddings are typically trained to capture distributional similarity, so that information can be shared among words that tend to appear in similar contexts. However, it is not possible to enumerate the entire vocabulary of any language, and even large unlabeled datasets will miss terms that appear in later applications. The issue of how to handle these out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words poses challenges for embedding-based methods. These challenges are particularly acute when working with lowresource languages, where even unlabeled data may be difficult to obtain at scale. A typical solution is to abandon hope, by assigning a single OOV embedding to all terms that do not appear in the unlabeled data. We approach this challenge from a quasigenerative perspective. Knowing nothing of a word except for its embedding and its written form, we attempt to learn the former from the latter. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) on the character level with the embedding as the target, and use it later to predict vectors for OOV words in any downstream task. We call this model the MIMICK-RNN, for its ability to read a wordâ€™s spelling and mimick its distributional embedding. Through nearest-neighbor analysis, we show that vectors learned via this method capture both word-shape features and lexical features. As a result, we obtain reasonable near-neighbors for OOV abbreviations, names, novel compounds, and orthographic errors. Quantitative evaluation on the Stanford RareWord dataset (Luong et al., 2013) provides more evidence that these character-based embeddings capture word similarity for rare and unseen words. As an extrinsic evaluation, we conduct experiments on joint prediction of part-of-speech tags and morphosyntactic attributes for a diverse set of 23 languages, as provided in the Universal Dependencies dataset (De Marneffe et al., 2014). Our model shows significant improvement across the board against a single UNK-embedding backoff method, and obtains competitive results against a supervised character-embedding model, which is trained end-to-end on the target task. In low-resource settings, our approach is particularly effective, and is complementary to supervised character embeddings trained from labeled data. The MIMICK-RNN therefore provides a useful new tool for tagging tasks in settings where there is limited labeled data. Models and code are available at www.github.com/ yuvalpinter/mimick .",
  "conclusion": "We present a straightforward algorithm to infer OOV word embedding vectors from pre-trained, limited-vocabulary models, without need to access the originating corpus. This method is particularly useful for low-resource languages and tasks with little labeled data available, and in fact is task-agnostic. Our method improves performance over word-based models on annotated sequence-tagging tasks for a large variety of languages across dimensions of family, orthography, and morphology. In addition, we present a Bi- LSTM approach for tagging morphosyntactic attributes at the token level. In this paper, the MIMICK model was trained using characters as input, but future work may consider the use of other subword units, such as morphemes, phonemes, or even bitmap representations of ideographic characters (Costa-juss`a et al., 2017)."

  {
   "<SENTENCE_1>": "The development of effective word representations is a cornerstone of progress in natural language processing (NLP), enabling systems to better understand and process human language by capturing semantic and syntactic nuances.",
  "<SENTENCE_2>": "Early approaches to word representation often treated words as atomic units, ignoring the rich morphological structure that many languages exhibit.",
  "<SENTENCE_3>": "This limitation has spurred research into more sophisticated models that can account for the internal structure of words, leading to significant improvements in various NLP tasks.",
  "<SENTENCE_4>": "One line of research has focused on leveraging morphological information to enhance word representations.",
  "<SENTENCE_5>": "For instance, the work by @cite_1 introduces a novel model that constructs representations for morphologically complex words from their constituent morphemes, combining recursive neural networks (RNNs) with neural language models to account for contextual information.",
  "<SENTENCE_6>": "This approach has shown to outperform existing word representations on word similarity tasks, highlighting the importance of morphological awareness in word representation.",
  "<SENTENCE_7>": "Similarly, @cite_4 presents a scalable method for integrating compositional morphological representations into vector-based probabilistic language models",
  "<SENTENCE_8>": "Another significant advancement in the field has been the adoption of character-level approaches in word representation",
  "<SENTENCE_9>": "The work by @cite_2 describes a neural language model that relies solely on character-level inputs, employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a highway network over characters to produce word-level predictions.",
  "<SENTENCE_10>": "This model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several languages, underscoring the sufficiency of character inputs for language modeling.",
  "<SENTENCE_11>": "@cite_5 further explores this direction by introducing a model that constructs vector representations of words by composing characters using bidirectional LSTMs", 
  "<SENTENCE_12>": "",
  "<SENTENCE_13>": "@cite_3 introduces CHARAGRAM embeddings, which represent textual sequences through character n-gram count vectors followed by a nonlinear transformation.",
  "<SENTENCE_14>": "This simple yet effective approach surpasses more complex architectures based on character-level RNNs and CNNs, setting new benchmarks on several similarity tasks.",
  "<SENTENCE_18>": "The integration of character-level information for part-of-speech tagging has been further explored by @cite_6, which proposes a deep neural network that combines word-level and character-level representations for enhanced accuracy in English and Portuguese.",
  "<SENTENCE_15>": "In addition to these developments, the field has seen efforts to enrich word embeddings with morpho-syntactic information.",
  "<SENTENCE_16>": "@cite_7 presents a graph-based semi-supervised learning method for generating morpho-syntactic lexicons, which, when used as features, improve performance in downstream tasks like morphological tagging and dependency parsing.",
  "<SENTENCE_17>": "@cite_8 proposes incorporating morphological information into word embeddings through a unified probabilistic framework, where morphological priors help improve embeddings for rare or unseen words.",
  "<SENTENCE_19>": "The method of refining vector space representations using relational information from semantic lexicons, as proposed by @cite_10, shows substantial improvements in lexical semantic evaluation tasks, highlighting the importance of semantic lexicons in word vector refinement.",
  "<SENTENCE_20>": "The challenges of morphological tagging in highly inflective languages are addressed by @cite_12, which uses an exponential probabilistic model to improve disambiguation of morphological categories.",
  "<SENTENCE_21>": "Lastly, @cite_13 proposes an improved taxonomy for capturing grammatical relations across languages, enhancing the cross-linguistic applicability of the Stanford Dependencies representation.",
  "<SENTENCE_22>": "This paper generates OOV word embeddings compositionally from spellings to distributional embeddings without requiring re-training on the original corpus.",
  "<SENTENCE_23>": "This method not only addresses the limitations of previous models in handling OOV words but also demonstrates the potential of type-level learning for improving performance across a wide range of languages and NLP tasks.",
  "<SENTENCE_24>": "By situating our work within this broader context, we aim to contribute to the ongoing dialogue in the field and address some of the gaps identified in previous research"
